## Dwarven Runecraft

My first attempt at a minecraft forge mod.

The aim of this project is primarily to have fun with creating
something for a game I have liked for a long time.

There is of course other benefits such as:
- Exposing myself to Java for the first time
- Improving my project solving and thinking
- Working on my debugging skills
- Generally just improving my abilities
